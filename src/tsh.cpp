/**
 * @brief Main loop for the shell, facilitating user interaction and command
 * execution.
 *
 * This function initializes a list to store Process objects, reads user input
 * in a loop, and executes the entered commands. The loop continues until the
 * user decides to quit.
 *
 * @note The function integrates several essential components:
 *   1. Displaying the shell prompt to the user.
 *   2. Reading user input using the read_input function.
 *   3. Parsing the input into a list of Process objects using parse_input.
 *   4. Executing the commands using run_commands.
 *   5. Cleaning up allocated resources to prevent memory leaks with the cleanup
 * function.
 *   6. Breaking out of the loop if the user enters the quit command.
 *   7. Continuously prompting the user for new commands until an exit condition
 * is met.
 *
 * @warning
 *  Initialize Necessary Variables:
 *      Declare variables for storing the list of Process objects, the input
 * line, and a flag for quitting. Read User Input in a Loop: Utilize a while
 * loop to continuously read user input until a termination condition is met.
 * Check for a valid input line and skip empty lines. Clean Up Resources: After
 * executing the commands, clean up allocated resources using the cleanup
 *      function to avoid memory leaks.
 *  Check for Quit Command:
 *      Determine if the user entered the quit command. If so, set the exit flag
 * to true and break out of the loop. Repeat the Process: If the user did not
 * quit, continue prompting for input by displaying the prompt again.
 *  Considerations:
 *      Handle edge cases such as empty input lines or unexpected errors
 * gracefully. Ensure proper error handling and informative messages for the
 * user.

 * @param cmd The command string to be parsed.
 * @param process_list A reference to a list of Process pointers where the

 *
 * Hints for students:
 * - The 'delimiters' variable holds the characters used to tokenize the command
 * string.
 * - 'pipe_in_val' is a flag indicating whether the current Process should take
 * input from a previous Process (1 if true, 0 if false).
 * - 'cmd_copy' is a duplicate of the original command string, and it's used to
 *   preserve the original string while tokenizing.
 * - 'currProcess' is a pointer to the current Process being created and added
 * to the list.
 * - The function uses strtok to tokenize the command based on delimiters and
 * iterates through the resulting tokens.
 * - For each token, a new Process object is created with relevant information,
 * and the pipe flags are set based on the presence of '|' in the original
 * command.
 * - The created Process objects are added to the process_list.
 * - After parsing, the memory allocated for 'cmd_copy' is freed.
 * - Finally, the split_string() method is called for each Process in the
 * process_list.

/**

 *
 * This function takes a list of processes and executes them sequentially,

 *
 * @param command_list A list of Process pointers representing the commands to
 * execute. Each Process object contains information about the command, such as
 *                     command tokens, pipe settings, and file descriptors.
 *
 * @return A boolean indicating whether a quit command was encountered during
 * execution. If true, the execution was terminated prematurely due to a quit
 * command; otherwise, false.
 *
 * @details
 * The function iterates through the provided list of processes and performs the
 * following steps:
 * 1. Check if a quit command is encountered. If yes, terminate execution.
 * 2. Create pipes and fork a child process for each command.
 * 3. In the parent process, close unused pipes, wait for child processes to
 * finish if necessary, and continue to the next command.
 * 4. In the child process, set up pipes for input and output, execute the
 * command using execvp, and handle errors if the command is invalid.
 * 5. Cleanup final process and wait for all child processes to finish.
 *
 * @note
 * - The function uses Process objects, which contain information about the
 * command and pipe settings.
 * - It handles sequential execution of commands, considering pipe connections
 * between them.
 * - The function exits with an error message if execvp fails to execute the
 * command.
 * - Make sure to properly manage file descriptors, close unused pipes, and wait
 * for child processes.
 * - The function returns true if a quit command is encountered during
 * execution; otherwise, false.
 *
 * @warning
 * - Ensure that the Process class is properly implemented and contains
 * necessary information about the command, such as command tokens and pipe
 * settings.
 * - The function relies on proper implementation of the isQuit function for
 * detecting quit commands.
 * - Students should understand the basics of forking, pipes, and process
 * execution in Unix-like systems.
